this is the controlls for the lobby.
if you are using the world that i chose for this game
and wont a lobby i would HIGHLY suggest not changing
this datapack, however if you are setting up your own lobby
or just dont want one than feel free to go ahead and deleat
this folder out of the datapack. it only purpose is for the
lobby and isnt referenced anywhere else so the pack wont 
break.
