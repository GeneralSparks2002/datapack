this is the "master control" section of the whole datapack
its not as nesasary as it sounds if you know how to use 
commands. this is more of an ease of use UI. this section
of the datapack, as mentioned already, is a UI that allows you
to set up the games with greater ease. i would not suggest messing
with this datapack too much.
